# Blackwolf-linux
My own Cyber Security Distro

# BlackWolf Linux
- All packges besides <code> Wallpapers</code> folder goes into <code>.config</code> hidden folder
- This is a script <code> install-packages.sh </code> that I have used over the years that I use to install all my programs for the <code> config </code> in the <code>i3wm</code> 
I am showing this until I am able to make an iso. So this is basically in the beta stages for now so

- Thank you and enjoy.  If there is anything that does not work please let me know and I can fix it.  I will be making a discord pretty soon as well.  

- <code> Black Wolf Linux </code> is for user who want to add Blackarch for their arch based systems.  There are tons of programs for archlinux as well.  I just used Blackarch with i3wm so that it will work correctly for what I need since I am going into Cyber Security in the future.
